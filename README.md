# ASCII_IMAGE_GENERATOR

TODO: 
* implement a radio button that lets you check if you want to scale the image down - good for high resolution images
* implement a canvas-type panel for the before/after images that let you zoom in like media-viewer functionalities
* implement multithreading for image processing
* implement some sort of algorithm to find the best contraints an image to generate a good ascii render

WHen not using the scalar function, there is real bad RAM hogging.
